**Project Overview**
=====================

This project is a microservices-based system that provides a suite of financial services, including accounts, cards, loans, and more. The system is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available.

**Microservices**
----------------

The system consists of the following microservices:

* **Accounts Service**: Responsible for managing user accounts, including account creation, updates, and queries.
* **Cards Service**: Handles card-related operations, such as card issuance, transactions, and balance inquiries.
* **Loans Service**: Provides loan-related services, including loan applications and creations.
* **Eureka Server**: Acts as a service registry and discovery mechanism for the microservices.
* **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for clients, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.

**Monitoring and Logging**
-------------------------

To ensure the system's reliability and performance, we have implemented the following monitoring and logging tools:

* **Micrometer Tracing**: Provides distributed tracing capabilities, allowing us to track requests across multiple microservices.
* **Zipkin**: Visualizes the tracing data, enabling us to identify performance bottlenecks and debug issues.
* **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from the microservices, providing insights into system performance and health.
* **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Centralizes logging, allowing us to monitor and analyze log data from across the system.

**Deployment**
--------------

The system can be deployed using either Docker Compose or Kubernetes. We have provided configuration files for both deployment options:

* **Docker Compose**: `deployment/docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory.
* **Kubernetes**: `deployments` file in the root directory.
* **Elk stack deployment file with docker** `elk-deployment-file` directory in the root directory.

**Getting Started**
-------------------

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the microservices using Maven or Gradle.
3. Start the Eureka Server.
4. Start the API Gateway.
5. Start the individual microservices (accounts, cards, loans).
6. Use the postman tool to test the API Gateway to access the microservices.
7. Alternatively use the postman to directly access the microservices endpoints.
